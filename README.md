# py_dev_ops
Project based on the book Python for DevOps by Alfredo Deza and Noah Gift

## Getting Started
This project's dependencies are managed through `poetry`.<br>
If you already have `poetry` up and running in your setup, you should be good to go by simply running 
`poetry install`.<br>
Otherwise, there is a great intro to setting up `poetry` [here](https://cjolowicz.github.io/posts/hypermodern-python-01-setup/).
The whole series is worth a read, but the first chapter should be enough to run this project. I have found the 
combination of `pipx` and `pyenv` to be the best, but feel free to experiment with other setups<br>
Also, [here](https://python-poetry.org/docs/#installing-with-pipx) you will find poetry's official documentation on 
how to install with `pipx`
